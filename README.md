## Project Tasks
1. Data Ingestion — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources
2. ETL System — We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format
3. Data lake — We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them
4. Scalability — As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it
5. Cloud — We can’t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use AWS
6. Reporting — Build a dashboard to get answers to the question we asked earlier
